Header: Same as before, including the logo, navigation menu, and possibly a search bar.

Hero Section with Carousel: Instead of a static hero image, you can use the carousel to 
display a rotating selection of high-quality images featuring various travel destinations,
 tour packages, or adventure activities. This dynamic element can capture users' attention 
 and create an immersive experience right from the homepage.

Featured Destinations: Below the hero section, continue to highlight featured destinations 
or tour packages, but now with more context provided by the carousel. Each destination can 
be represented by a card or tile within the carousel, allowing users to scroll through them horizontally.

About Us: Include information about your travel company in a separate section below the featured 
destinations. You can maintain the same content as before, focusing on your company's mission, values, 
and unique offerings.

Services: Highlight your range of services, such as guided tours, accommodations, transportation options,
 and special packages. This section can complement the carousel by providing additional details about the 
 services associated with the featured destinations.

Testimonials: If applicable, integrate testimonials within the homepage layout, perhaps below the featured 
destinations or as part of a separate section. Testimonials can reinforce the appeal of your offerings and 
build trust with potential customers.

Blog/Travel Guides: Consider incorporating a section dedicated to travel guides, tips, and blog posts.
 While the carousel and featured destinations capture users' attention with visuals, informative content 
 can further engage them and provide valuable insights into travel experiences.

Contact Us: Maintain a clear call-to-action for users to contact your travel company for inquiries, bookings,
 or assistance. This can be placed strategically within the homepage layout, ensuring easy access for 
 interested visitors.

Footer: As before, include a footer section with links to important pages, social media profiles,
 and legal information.
